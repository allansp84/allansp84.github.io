%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[height=1.2in,clip,keepaspectratio]{aczajka}}]{Adam Czajka} Adam Czajka is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the College of Engineering here at the University of Notre Dame. He received his M.Sc. in Computer Control Systems and his Ph.D. in Biometrics from Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), Poland (both with honors). He is also an Assistant Professor with the Research and Academic Computer Network -- national research institute (NASK), Poland. His scientific interests include biometrics and security, computer vision, and machine learning. Before coming to Notre Dame, Dr. Czajka was the Chair of the Biometrics and Machine Learning Laboratory at the Institute of Control and Computation Engineering at WUT, the Head of the Postgraduate Studies on Security and Biometrics, the Vice Chair of the NASK Biometrics Laboratory, and a member of the NASK Research Council. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE, the Chair of the Polish Standardization Committee on Biometrics, and an active member of the European Association for Biometrics. He serves as Associate Editor in the IEEE Access, an Editorial Board member in the IET Biometrics, as well as the Program Committee member and reviewer for various conferences and journals in biometrics and security, including IEEE T-IFS, IET Biometrics and Elsevier Pattern Recognition Letters.\end{IEEEbiography}

%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[height=1.2in,clip,keepaspectratio]{kwb}}]{Kevin W. Bowyer} is the Schubmehl-Prein Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Dr. Bowyer's research interests range broadly across computer vision and pattern recognition, including biometrics, data mining and classifier ensembles. Dr. Bowyer received a 2014 Technical Achievement Award from the IEEE Computer Society, ``For pioneering contributions to the science and engineering of biometrics'', is a Fellow of the IEEE ``for contributions to algorithms for recognizing objects in images'', a Fellow of the IAPR, ``for contributions to computer vision, pattern recognition and biometrics'', and a Golden Core Member of the IEEE Computer Society. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE TPAMI, and also served as EIC of the IEEE Biometrics Compendium, and is currently on the editorial board of IEEE Access. Dr. Bowyer served as General Chair of the 2015 and the 2017 IEEE FG Conf., General Chair of the 2015 IEEE BTAS Conf., and Research and Innovation Session Chair for Biometrics in 2014, 2015 and 2016. His Handbook of Iris Recognition, edited with Mark Burge, is now in its Second Edition. Dr. Bowyer has made substantial contributions in the areas of iris recognition, face recognition, and multi-modal and cross-sensor biometrics.\end{IEEEbiography}
