\begin{abstract}
Biometrics systems have significantly improved person
identification and authentication, playing an important role in
personal, national, and global security. However, these systems
might be deceived (or ``spoofed'') and, despite the recent advances
in spoofing detection, current solutions often rely on domain
knowledge, specific biometric reading systems, and attack types. We
assume a very limited knowledge about biometric spoofing at the
sensor to derive outstanding spoofing detection systems for iris,
face, and fingerprint modalities based on two deep learning
approaches.
The first approach consists of learning suitable convolutional 
network architectures for each domain, while the second approach
focuses on learning the weights of the network via back-propagation. We
consider nine biometric spoofing benchmarks --- each one containing
real and fake samples of a given biometric modality and attack type
--- and learn deep representations for each benchmark by combining and
contrasting the two learning approaches. This strategy not only
provides better comprehension of how these approaches interplay, but
also creates systems that exceed the best known results in eight out
of the nine benchmarks. The results strongly indicate that spoofing
detection systems based on convolutional networks can be robust to
attacks already known and possibly adapted, with little effort, to
image-based attacks that are yet to come.

% Biometrics systems have drastically improved person identification
% and/or authentication, playing an important role in personal,
% national, and global security. However, such systems might be
% deceived or ``spoofed'' and, despite the advances in
% spoofing detection to each biometric modality, there is still a lack
% of a clearly unified approach. Aiming at filling this gap, we
% propose a unified framework to learn deep representations for three
% different modalities of spoofing biometrics (i.e., face, iris, and
% fingerprint). The representations are learned directly from the
% data with an optimization procedure that randomly searches for the best
% convolutional neural network from a family of networks defined in a hyperparameter search
% space. Atop these representations, we couple a linear Support Vector Machine
% classifiers for the final
% decision making. Instead of learning thousands and/or millions of
% network weights/parameters based either on back-propagation-like or unsupervised
% feature learning techniques, our networks use random filter weights initialized in a 
% convenient way, which allows us to quickly probe thousands of network configurations.
% Experiments on nine publicly available benchmarks of these 
% three modalities show that our framework achieves either very 
% competitive or state-of-the-art results for all problems and modalities.
